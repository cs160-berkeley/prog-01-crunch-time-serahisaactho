# PROG 01: Crunch Time

Briefly describe your app here.

This app allows the user to enter his or her mode of exercise (out of 4 options - pushups, situps, jumping jacks, jog), followed by the number of reps/minutes. The app displays the number of calories burned based on the given information. The user has the option to view equivalent periods of exercise that burn the same amount of calories, via a button.
